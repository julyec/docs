We&#39;ll explore this directory in more detail soon; however, almost all of the classes in your application will be in this directory.</p><p><a name="the-bootstrap-directory"></a></p><h4 id="the-bootstrap-directory" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-bootstrap-directory" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Bootstrap Directory</h4><p>The <code>bootstrap</code> directory contains the <code>app.php</code> file which bootstraps the framework. This directory also houses a <code>cache</code> directory which contains framework generated files for performance optimization such as the route and services cache files. You should not typically need to modify any files within this directory.</p><p><a name="the-config-directory"></a></p><h4 id="the-config-directory" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-config-directory" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Config Directory</h4><p>The <code>config</code> directory, as the name implies, contains all of your application&#39;s configuration files. It&#39;s a great idea to read through all of these files and familiarize yourself with all of the options available to you.</p><p><a name="the-database-directory"></a></p><h4 id="the-database-directory" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-database-directory" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Database Directory</h4><p>The <code>database</code> directory contains your database migrations, model factories, and seeds.

This directory also houses your assets such as images, JavaScript, and CSS.</p><p><a name="the-resources-directory"></a></p><h4 id="the-resources-directory" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-resources-directory" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Resources Directory</h4><p>The <code>resources</code> directory contains your <a href="./views">views</a> as well as your raw, un-compiled assets such as CSS or JavaScript.</p><p><a name="the-routes-directory"></a></p><h4 id="the-routes-directory" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-routes-directory" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Routes Directory</h4><p>The <code>routes</code> directory contains all of the route definitions for your application. By default, several route files are included with Laravel: <code>web.php</code>, <code>api.php</code>, <code>console.php</code>, and <code>channels.php</code>.</p><p>The <code>web.php</code> file contains routes that the <code>RouteServiceProvider</code> places in the <code>web</code> middleware group, which provides session state, CSRF protection, and cookie encryption. If your application does not offer a stateless, RESTful API then all your routes will most likely be defined in the <code>web.php</code> file.</p><p>The <code>api.php</code> file contains routes that the <code>RouteServiceProvider</code> places in the <code>api</code> middleware group. These routes are intended to be stateless, so requests entering the application through these routes are intended to be authenticated <a href="./sanctum">via tokens</a> and will not have access to session state.</p><p>The <code>console.php</code> file is where you may define all of your closure based console commands. Each closure is bound to a command instance allowing a simple approach to interacting with each command&#39;s IO methods. Even though this file does not define HTTP routes, it defines console based entry points (routes) into your application.</p><p>The <code>channels.php</code> file is where you may register all of the <a href="./broadcasting">event broadcasting</a> channels that your application supports.</p><p><a name="the-storage-directory"></a></p><h4 id="the-storage-directory" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-storage-directory" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Storage Directory</h4><p>The <code>storage</code> directory contains your logs, compiled Blade templates, file based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework. This directory is segregated into <code>app</code>, <code>framework</code>, and <code>logs</code> directories. The <code>app</code> directory may be used to store any files generated by your application. The <code>framework</code> directory is used to store framework generated files and caches. Finally, the <code>logs</code> directory contains your application&#39;s log files.</p><p>The <code>storage/app/public</code> directory may be used to store user-generated files, such as profile avatars, that should be publicly accessible. You should create a symbolic link at <code>public/storage</code> which points to this directory.

Think of the <code>Console</code> and <code>Http</code> directories as providing an API into the core of your application. The HTTP protocol and CLI are both mechanisms to interact with your application, but do not actually contain application logic. In other words, they are two ways of issuing commands to your application. The <code>Console</code> directory contains all of your Artisan commands, while the <code>Http</code> directory contains your controllers, middleware, and requests.</p><p>A variety of other directories will be generated inside the <code>app</code> directory as you use the <code>make</code> Artisan commands to generate classes. So, for example, the <code>app/Jobs</code> directory will not exist until you execute the <code>make:job</code> Artisan command to generate a job class.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong><br> Many of the classes in the <code>app</code> directory can be generated by Artisan via commands. To review the available commands, run the <code>php artisan list make</code> command in your terminal.</p></blockquote><p><a name="the-broadcasting-directory"></a></p><h4 id="the-broadcasting-directory" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-broadcasting-directory" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Broadcasting Directory</h4><p>The <code>Broadcasting</code> directory contains all of the broadcast channel classes for your application. These classes are generated using the <code>make:channel</code> command. This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you when you create your first channel. To learn more about channels, check out the documentation on <a href="./broadcasting">event broadcasting</a>.</p><p><a name="the-console-directory"></a></p><h4 id="the-console-directory" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-console-directory" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Console Directory</h4><p>The <code>Console</code> directory contains all of the custom Artisan commands for your application. These commands may be generated using the <code>make:command</code> command. This directory also houses your console kernel, which is where your custom Artisan commands are registered and your <a href="./scheduling">scheduled tasks</a> are defined.</p><p><a name="the-events-directory"></a></p><h4 id="the-events-directory" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-events-directory" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Events Directory</h4><p>This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you by the <code>event:generate</code> and <code>make:event</code> Artisan commands. The <code>Events</code> directory houses <a href="./events">event classes</a>.
